# slack-export-local

## Background

Slack announced a new policy, effective from August 26th, 2024, that messages and files older than one year in workspaces on the free tier would be **deleted**.
This is in addition to the 90 day limit for viewing content in the workspace.

## Partial solution

There is an excellent tool [https://github.com/hfaran/slack-export-viewer](https://github.com/hfaran/slack-export-viewer) that can generate a viewable archive of your slack workspace.

It is possible to compile a full archive of a workspace using this tool.
To do so, one needs to export the workspace data at 90 day intervals and compile the exports to generate a full archive.
Or perhaps the workspace has had a free trial at the paid offering and a full export has been generated.

By default `slack-export-viewer` serves up a viewable archive as a flask application.
It is also possible to generate a local html instance of the archive using:

```
slack-export-viewer -z path/to/archive.zip --html-only
```

The archive is viewable in both cases, but **the content is external**.
It is only a partial solution because **all the content will disappear when slack deletes any files older than one year**.

## Full solution

This repo is aimed at modifying the local html instance generated by `slack-export-viewer` so that all files are downloaded, and stored and linked as a local copy.

### How to:

- generate the local instance of your slack archive
- download `slack-export-local.py` script
- edit the paths to your local instance (usually `~/html-output/`) in the script
- run using `python slack-export-local.py`

Requires python3 and beautifulsoup.

Note that the paths in the html files are relative so that it is possible to move or rename the `html-output` folder and it should still work.

### To do:

- check if file is already downloaded before attempting download (speed up)
- give paths as arguments
- show progress during the download
